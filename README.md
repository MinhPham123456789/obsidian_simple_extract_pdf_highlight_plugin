# obsidian_simple_extract_pdf_highlight_plugin

Based on the work at the repository https://github.com/munach/obsidian-extract-pdf-annotations<br>
Also the ribbon work based on the repository https://github.com/akaalias/obsidian-extract-pdf-highlights

## Approach
When click on the button, a new markdown is generated with all the highlights in the document and the markdown is saved under the same directory as the document.
